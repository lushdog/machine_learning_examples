algebra dot-product of two vectors is = sum of (product of matching elements), results in scalar
geometric (euclidean) dot-product of two vectors = ||a|| ||b|| cos(angle between a and b)
magnitude (length) of a vector is  ||x|| = sqrt of (sum of (elements squared))
distance between two vectors is d(x,y) = ||x - y|| = sqrt of (sum of (difference of elements squared))
matrix multiplied by it's inverse returns identity matrix A
only a square matrix can have an inverse
determinant of matrix is the scaling factor of the transform described by matrix - det(A)
only square matrices have determinants
outer product of two vectors is used to determine covariance of sample vectors
dot product of two vectors is called inner-product
matrix trace is the sum of the diagonals 
matrix transpose: X is 3x2 matrix, X.T is 2x3 matrix with values flipped over the diag
a symmetric matrix is equal to it's transpose, thus X = X.T
covariance is the relation between two variables, positive covariance means an increase in one variable means an increase in another
covariance matrix shows the covariance for variables in a vector, i.e. X[i] and X[j] have their covariance located at E[i,j]

linear systems: Ax = b 
A is matrix coefficents, x is vector of variables, b is vector of answers
solve for x = A.inv * b

Example:
x    + 2y  + 1z  = 5
2x   + 5y  + 2z = 10
       1y  + 1z = 3

A = [[1,2,1],[2,5,2],[0,1,1]]  x = [x, y, z]  b=[5,10,3]
A.inv = [[3,-1,-1],[-2,1,0],[2,-1,1]]
A.inv*b = x = [2,0,3] (solution for values x, y z)

Unlimited solutions (undetermined) if rows in A less than num unknonwns in x
1 solution if (unique) rows in A same as num unknowns in x
No solutions if more rows in A than num unknowns in x
